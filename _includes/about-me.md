My name is Wojtek and I am a software engineer from Krak√≥w, Poland. You have come to my personal website of sort.

I got insterested in computer science when I was a teenager and I never quitted.

Currently working full-time as a C++ developer and my interests include modern C++ and a bunch of different langauges (like Python and Rust), Linux, high performance applications and embedded designs. I also like drinking coffee and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33351959-wojtek).
