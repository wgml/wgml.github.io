# About me

My name is Wojtek and I am a software engineer from Krak√≥w, Poland. You have come to my personal website of sort.

I got insterested in computer science when I was a teenager and I never quit.
Currently working full-time as a C++ developer, my interests include modern C++ and a bunch of other langauges (like Python and Rust), Linux, high performance applications and embedded designs. I am also a fan of drinking coffee, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33351959-wojtek) and playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/wgml) badly.

Find me [@github](https://github.com/wgml), [@linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wgmla/) or via [mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
